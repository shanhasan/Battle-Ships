#Battle Ships#


For our second week at Makers, we have been asked to design a game called Battle Ships modulated on the board game, where there are two players and each player takes turns in trying to sink the opponent ships.
The winner is the player who sinks all of the opponent's ships. 


We are **_Team D_** and our members include:

- Shan Hasan
- Giorgia Amici
- Richard Lake
- Edward Byne
- Dale Stevens
